Gamers who stumble upon this website can also sign up for the latest updates. They have the choice to subscribe for the updates of whichever game they would like. These updates are sent to their e-mail.

# DESIGN RATIONALE
As a user of this page, I want to explore the different games Call of Duty has to offer so that I can decide which game I should install. 
As a user of this page, I want to sign up for updates so that I can be more alert and aware of any new features I can get. 

So as to promote Call Of Duty's newest release, Modern Warfare II, the overall colour scheme of this website follows its palette, which is mainly green and black.

In each page, the trailer takes up majority of the space as gamers are more inclined to download or purchase the game after watching a clip of the said game. Giving new gamers a trailer to watch will also allow them to clearly visualise the game before reading more about it to make a decision on which game to install.
