This website is targeted at those who are interested to start playing Call Of Duty and want to know the gist of it. The landing page shows the more popular and recent games COD has released.
 This website condenses all the information to mainly give users the:
 - trailer
 - summarised version of what each campaign is about
 - link to the latest blog there is for that game
 - link to purchase or download the game

So as to promote Call Of Duty's newest release, Modern Warfare II, the overall colour scheme of this website follows its palette, which is mainly green and black.

In each page, the trailer takes up majority of the space as gamers are more inclined to download or purchase the game after watching a clip of the said game. Giving new gamers a trailer to watch will also allow them to clearly visualise the game before reading more about it to make a decision on which game to install. 

Gamers who stumble upon this website can also sign up for the latest updates. They have the choice to subscribe for the updates of whichever game they would like. These updates are sent to their e-mail.
